# GitFlow in Data Science Projects

Coming soon!

Outline:

- What is GitFlow?
  - A brief history: software world
  - Why it works in software development
- How we can use GitFlow in DS context
  - Define a problem to investigate.
  - Define a deliverable of some kind.
    - Software: code
    - Analysis: plots or notebook with a concluding statement
    - Scope out what action will be taken on the basis of the analysis.
    - If no action can be taken, analysis priority should go down.
  - Create issue describing a plan for what needs to be done.
  - Create off from `master` branch in which that work is done.
  - Finish the work, merge branch into master, and close issue.
  - Raise new issues as they show up.
- Changes to DS mindset to adopt GitFlow
  - Cannot carry out endless analyses. End point + action required.
  - Forces us to be more thoughtful about how we spend our time.
    - Does not restrict the problem space though!
    - We are still free to investigate problems.
    - We just have to justify and document them better.
