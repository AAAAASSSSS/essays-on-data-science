# Code Formatting

<!-- Important because code is meant to be read more than it is meant to be written -->
<!-- Consistent code style makes it much easier to read your code. -->
<!-- Letting a code formatter do the hard work of formatting code properly
reduces the amount of frustration you have later doing it manually. -->
