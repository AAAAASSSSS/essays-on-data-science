# How I Learned to Learn

In this essay, I'd like to reflect back on
how I learned to learn new things.
For a data scientist, it's impossible to know _everything_,
but I do think that having a broad knowledge base can be very handy.
Especially when confronted with a new problem class,
having a broad toolkit of methods to solve it
can give us a leg-up in terms of efficiency.

## Learning by doing/building/making

"Carving out time to make things."

## Learning by teaching

"Having made the thing, share it."

## Leveraging existing knowledge

"Projects that are adjacenct to what I know how to do."

## Seeking learning partners and teachers

Acknowledge David Duvenaud and Colin Carroll.
